For graphics tkinter has been used. The main code is found in Main.py, from which some additional helper functions are imported from helpers.py.

In addition to the standard functionalities of any minesweeper game, the following features have been implemented:

<ul>
  <li>To adjust the game duration, the size of the gameboard can be set dynamically from a minimum of 10×10 cells to a maximum of 50×50 cells.</li>
  <li>To adjust the difficulty, the probability that each cell will contain a mine can be set anywhere between 10 and 30 %.</li>
  <li>If you get stuck, there's an optional cheat function in the menu which reveals any mines marked with a flag (mines can be marked with a flag by double right-clicking).</li>
</ul>
